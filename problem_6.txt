1) Create a function to create a map to get the frecuency of each number in the first list.
2) Found the frecuency of each number in list 1
3) For the intersection loop the second list if is in the map means is a intersection and add the value to the intersection list
4) For the union is a little more large first add the first list to a union list and add the frecuencies to the map 
   if is in the map not need to added but need to move the frecuency of the number - 1, beacuse exist other equal number and the  
   frecuency is 0 that means we can add the number, if is not in the list we can only add the number.


We have a function to add the frecuencies is a list loop = O(n)  n = list size

We have a funtion to intersection should be O(n) = add the frecuencies + O(m) = loop list 2 = O(n + m)

We have a funtion to union should be O(n) = add the frecuencies + O(m) = loop list 2 =  + O(p) = loop list 1 = O(n + m + p)
